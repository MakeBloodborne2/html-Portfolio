<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello World! My name is Blake Middleton, I am a young web designer who is learning the ropes of html! I have thoroughly enjoyed my time coding so far and hope to do more.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding I am often found buidling Gunpla models, another time consuming pass time with great rewards for patience and persistence. <p>

<p>Hopefully what is now (in early 2024) a newly found interest for me can blossom into a new world of possibilites, and this portfolio will only get better with time.
   I'm already excited to look back on this project one day and see the progress I have made.</p>
